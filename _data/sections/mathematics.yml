  description: Complex numbers are useful abstract quantities that can be used in calculations and result in physically meaningful solutions.
- name: Differential equations
  link: /guide/MPS/mathematics/differential-equations/index.html
  description: A differential equation is an equation that contains one or more functions with its derivatives. The derivatives of the function define the rate of change of a function at a point. The main purpose of differential equation is the study of solutions that satisfy the equations, and the properties of the solutions.
