Are you an iconic figure? Do you know where to find great images, or how to create attractive illustrations?
<!-- excerpt-end -->
{{ site.brand }} is a great resource for blind learners. However, it should also engage sighted users. It should especially be aware of the needs of learning disabled learners, who may benefit from stories told through easy read pictures. The challenge is great, but we are confident we can make it work. So if you are good at finding, creating, and adding images to our content, please help. 

#### Who am I looking for?

Somebody, who:

+ has an artistic skill and a good eye for identifying where text should be complemented with images;
+ knows where to find illustrations, or how to create them with ease;
+ has a skill to turn a text-heavy webpage into an engaging work of art, using the right icons and images;
+ understands what it takes to author a good alt text of images.

#### What am I looking for?

Some of the ToDo items that I'd happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :

+ finding, creating, and adding visual assets to existing content;
+ creating a process of using visual assets, and maintaining a pool of resources or tools to rely on, when we are authoring new content.
