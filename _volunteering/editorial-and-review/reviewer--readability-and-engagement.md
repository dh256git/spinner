Is your vocabulary an infinite space? Is your favourite dinosaur a thesaurus?
<!-- excerpt-end -->
We want our content to be as accessible as possible to learning disabled people, and generally an easy read to all. The notes and posts should also be engaging - not only thought provoking, and educational. We like short sentences, and dislike spelling mistakes. If you have a good eye for catching missing punctuations, and a talent to cheer written content up, please consider becoming a reviewer for readability and engagement.

#### Who am I looking for?

Somebody, who:

+ pays attention to detail, and is good with words;
+ is able to review written text, and suggest improvements to its readability;
+ has a skill to turn a fact sheet into an engaging work of art, using the right vocabulary.

#### What am I looking for?

Some of the ToDo items that I'd happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :

+ reviewing existing pages on the {{ site.brand }} website;
+ suggesting changes to text by editing content and creating pull requests.
