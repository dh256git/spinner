Have you heard of the "diffusion of innovation" curve? Do you know how it relates to marketing?
<!-- excerpt-end -->
Once we identify the innovators in the space we claim, we also need to race towards the early majority of adopters.
If you have a talent or experience in getting conversions nailed, please manage our sales and marketing tasks.

#### Who am I looking for?

Somebody, who:

+ has past experience with identifying innovators and knows what a market persona is, or learns quickly;
+ knows where to start with market research, and how to work with early adopters;
+ is able to convert expressions of interest into revenue.

#### What am I looking for?

Some of the ToDo items that I'd happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :

+ creating a sales and marketing strategy;
+ collecting data and using evidence to make market choices by getting out and talking to customers;
+ working with a team member responsible for branding and communications.
