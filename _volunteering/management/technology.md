Do you code? Can you do research? Do you have good person skills and academic connections?
<!-- excerpt-end -->
This is a task for somebody who can roll their sleeves up, and get hands-on with technical research and development. That's not only it. You will also need to be a good team player, and pull all the research and development work together from a range of people, working on a range of R&D tasks.

#### Who am I looking for?

Somebody, who:

+ has past experience with Git Hub, LaTeX, MathML, Jekyll, screen readers, or learns quickly;
+ has experience with agile project management and web development;
+ knows the latest trend in styling and scripting, keeps up with the development of accessibility practices, and can think creatively about the application of existing tools on the web;
+ can come up, and implement, an agenda for research and development tasks.

#### What am I looking for?

Some of the ToDo items that I'd happily delegate to a helpful volunteer, include :

+ management of cross-platform operability, and distributed systems;
+ cracking tough challenges in screen reader access to equations and visualisations on the web;
+ leading and motivating a team of developers to research and solve challenges on the roadmap of {{ site.product }}.
