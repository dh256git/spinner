## About {{ site.brand }}

We are a small family business, supporting blind or learning disabled people, and the community around them.
{{ site.brand }} combines for-profit practices with nonprofit missions to create positive outcomes in a sustainable way.

### What we do

We engage in multiple key activities to support our mission.

1. **Sharing thoughts**: We share our lived experience of sight-loss, learning disability, and success, through our [blog.]({% link blog/index.html %})
2. **Passive learning**: We enable people to learn about science and lifestyle, by creating accessible articles in the [{{ site.brand }} {{ site.product }}.]({% link guide/index.html %})
3. **Active learning**: We promote active learning, by [getting volunteers involved]({% link volunteering/index.md %}) in building the [{{ site.brand }} {{ site.product }}.]({% link guide/index.html %})
4. **Consultancy**: Anyone who needs time to talk things through with us can [book a support session]({% link support/index.md %}) for a session of consulting, tutoring, or mentoring.
5. **Research and innovation**: We work with academic researchers and businesses to push the frontiers of access to science, and disability inclusion.

### Who we are

We are Daniel and Danielle, a couple from Brighton, England.
We wanted to learn, so we started developing {{ site.brand }}.
We live with disabilities, and we have a lot to share.

### Our history

Daniel wanted to collect his physics notes, and family recipes, in one place. 
He set two conditions for this library:

- notes must be accessible for blind readers, like himself; and
- notes must provide the same user experience regardless what device it is viewed on.

This quickly turned into an exciting challenge of web development.
After Danielle joined the team, we realised that there are many [skills that matter to us.]({% link about/skills.md %})
We wanted to get better at doing certain things, by building {{ site.brand }} bit by bit.
This was always meant to be a private project.
Then, we realised, we can help people, while they help us.
