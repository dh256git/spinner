Hello, my name is Danielle and I'm working on Project27. 

I was born in 1993 with a left sided hemiplegia, I am blind in my left eye and I have nystagmus in my right eye. I also have a learning disability. 

I work with people who have a learning disability and I really enjoy helping other people. While working I discovered I like to create video content and writing articles that people can learn from. 

In Project27 one of the areas what I focus on is the Lifestyle collection. I focus on the vocal section where I will be creating audio blogs to talk about things that are important to me and others. 

I want to show that people with a learning disability and people who have a visual impairment can cook and learn new skills along the way. 

Kind regards,

Danielle
