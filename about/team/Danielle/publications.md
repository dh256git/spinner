I have grown a passion to write, review and share articles on learning disability and self-advocacy.

1. [50 years of speaking up; towards a important history.](https://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/intellectual-disability-in-the-twentieth-century) Published in "Intellectual Disability in the Twentieth Century"
 + This was my first ever article that has been published in a book.
2. [In response to "Now that I'm connected this isn't social isolation, this is engaging with people”: Staying connected during the COVID-19 pandemic".](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/14683156/0/0) Published in the British Journal of Learning Disabilities.
 + I co-authored a review, in response to an academic article on learning disability and social isolation.
3. [Speak Out With Danielle](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBe28FMnUFt0ino5K_KHyVmg5m6YJ0JvW) (YouTube playlist)
 + Speak Out with Danielle is a video series that I created to let people with learning disabilities express themselves and to let everyone else know that they are not alone in there thoughts and feelings. 
4. ['We are here'](https://youtu.be/JOBI0CbcboI) - A film about the experiences of learning disabled people during the COVID19 pandemic
 + By the end of the Covid19 pandemic, I helped write, film and edit a film called We are here. This film was for people who have learning disabilities to say and show how and what they was feeling during the Covid19 pandemic.
