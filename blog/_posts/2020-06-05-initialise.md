This blog category is here to capture posts about issues and their solutions during the development of {{ site.brand }}. We are learning as we build, so undoubtedly there will be issues to fix. There will be many issues, at pretty much all times.
<!-- excerpt-end -->

We use Trello and our scrum workflow to track and work on these issues, we use GitHub to track major issues, and we also want to post them here in a more wordy way. In part, this will help us to log all tracked issues, and make our struggles and solution strategies more visible, more transparent to anyone, who may wish to chip in.

We want feedback. We want to build with you, and not for you. We want to build, measure, and learn, then repeat the cycle.

### Quick links

Before we explain, everything you need to get started in one place:

1. [Git Hub issues](https://github.com/dh256git/project27/issues)
2. [View issues on Trello](https://trello.com/b/0TnZCOLE/issue-tracking)
3. [Report issues via e-mail](mailto:dhajas+uuw95qpr3nkff4ghokvs@boards.trello.com)
4. [Bug report template]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/documents/Project27--Issue-Tracking-Template--bug-report.md %})
5. [Feature request template]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/documents/Project27--Issue-Tracking-Template--feature-request.md %})

### Types and labels of issues

We have two main issue types:

1. Bug reports: for things that don't work well, or don't work at all;
2. Feature requests: for capturing new ideas for the pipeline of future development.

We also try and categorise these issues into four labels or lists:

1. accessibility: for any general issues around web accessibility and usability with a screen reader;
2. content: for factual errors, typos, and anything to do with the content (even copyright concerns);
3. functionality: for lack of a better word, this list tracks broken links, javascript issues etc;
4. styling: for problems around the visual appearance of any content on the site, such as overflowing tables or paragraphs, inappropriately sized images, and colour contrast issues.

### Why not just use Git Hub?

We do! If you are feeling adventurous, please [open a new issue on our Git Hub repository](https://github.com/dh256git/project27/issues). However, we like multiple options, transparency, tidy organisation, details, and simple ways for everyone to contribute.

We want to have a place, where we acknowledge issues, instead of hiding them. These may be issues around accessibility or usability, there may be factual errors in the content, or simply typos, but it may also be that the visual styling of a page or a link is broken.

### View known issues: Our public Trello board

We have a [public board](https://trello.com/b/0TnZCOLE/issue-tracking) to track issues.
Use Trello to view what issues are already known by us, and shoot an e-mail to add to this Trello board.

### Report an issue

If there is an issue you spotted, and you would like to let us know, you can [e-mail the issue into the inbox list](mailto:dhajas+uuw95qpr3nkff4ghokvs@boards.trello.com) on the public Trello board. 

Simply put a brief "issue title" in the subject of the e-mail, and a full description of the issue in the body of the e-mail. We appreciate these descriptions to be written in markdown.

We even crafted two handy issue templates, which you can copy directly into the body of your e-mail, fill in, then send. If you prefer free-style feedback, that's fine too. Templates help us, but are not a must.

### Issue templates

Choose one of two templates, depending on the type of issue you would like to raise.

1. [Bug report]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/documents/Project27--Issue-Tracking-Template--bug-report.md %})
2. [Feature request]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/documents/Project27--Issue-Tracking-Template--feature-request.md %})

Thanks in advance for all the helpful contributions.
