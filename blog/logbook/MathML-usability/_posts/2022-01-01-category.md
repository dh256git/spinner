MathML seems to be the best way around web accessibility of mathematical content. However, whether we use content or presentation style MathML, whether we use one web browser or another, or whether we use one screen reader software versus another will impact the usability and user experience of mathematical content.

The posts in this category will focus on MathML usability in various settings. I will experiment with different methods of creating MathML content, and different ways to read the same content. I hope to be able to provide insights on which methods work most reliably, and which provide the most consistent, best usability.
