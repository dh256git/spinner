Last month we promised to reveal the Project27 banner on YouTube.
The time has come, we made space for publishing or curating videos, alongside our written posts.

### Why do we need a YouTube channel?

Written posts are great, but some people prefer to listen, or watch content.
We realised that our audiences may benefit from the occasional video, or podcast placed next to our blog posts and {{ site.product }} notes.
Hence, we created a [YouTube channel for {{ site.brand }}](https://youtube.com/@project27skills) to make space for such audio-visual content.

### Playlists

We begin our YouTube journey with two playlists: Cookbook, and Blog.
If a YouTube link is available for any of our posts, we will embed this right under the post title.

Cookbook is a good example of a curated playlist, where we will not upload our own videos.
What we will do instead is to cherrypick existing content.
This means, we will find videos that we endorse, and share them through our channel.
Cookbook is a great place to start, as there are many excellent cooking shows out there.

Blog on the other-hand will have podcasts, audio, and video we are going to produce eventually.
This is where we have decided to debut our logo and banner.
Enjoy our intro tune, and thank Dominic for allowing us to use his amazing voice.
