This blog category of Nanotips and FAQs gives home to two type of posts.
<!-- excerpt-end -->

Firstly, this category is the collection box of random, very short posts on tips I want to preserve for my future reference and share with whoever is interested. Often, this may be just a cool new project, product I came across, with a few sentences and a link to external further reading and resources.

Secondly, I found myself typing and re-typing the same sort of answers, collection of pointers, resources, and advice to various people, who in different stages of my life asked more or less the same questions. Hence, this category also includes a couple of standard posts, which are answers to my personal FAQs and I'm happy to share with people as a first response before going into more bespoke discussions.
