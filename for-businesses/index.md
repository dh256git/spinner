We work with businesses to identify opportunities for innovation in accessibility, diffuse the latest research and development outputs, and scale solutions that work for blind or learning disabled people.

### Innovation opportunities in accessibility

Is your business mindful of blind or learning disabled consumers?
If not yet, we can help you find the right entry point to accessibility.

However, if you are passionate about staying on top of the latest developments;
we can help you identify innovation opportunities in accessibility.

### Diffuse the latest products of research

We work with academic partners to understand the real accessibility challenges blind or learning disabled people face.
Then, we engage with researchers in an iterative co-design process to design solutions that work.

These solutions need to find their way to end-users, like the blind or learning disabled consumers you might have.
Early adopter businesses can accelerate the impact of products of research, by diffusing innovation that works.
Innovation works, when your consumers get a solution to their problem, and your business sees the value in disability inclusion.

### Scale innovation that works

Does the solution work as well for a part of your business, as it does for blind or learning disabled individuals?
If so, you can scale the innovation across your entire business, or pull other businesses with you.
We can support your business with developing a scale strategy for innovation in the accessibility of your products or services.
