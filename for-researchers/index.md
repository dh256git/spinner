We enable researchers to understand the real problems blind or learning disabled people experience, through an iterative process of co-design and consultancy, such that the right research questions are addressed.

### Build your next research project on the foundations of co-design!

Send us a research inquiry to find out how can co-design activities fit with your research project.

## Ways we can help

Our contributions often correspond to levels of technology-readiness within the respective research project.

### Validating the research assumptions

In the early phases of a research project, co-design can help with validating the research assumptions.
Don't just test your research prototypes in a user study, after many months of work.
Co-design collaborators can ensure your research stays on track throughout the entire project, using an agile and disability inclusive research method.

### Branching the line of research

During the first co-design collaboration, researchers uncover new and exciting research questions, which fall outside the initial research scope.
In addition, publishing the research outputs, early adopters from industry and the community may introduce new requirements and challenges, grounded in real-world use-cases.
Working with a collaborator, who has lived experience of disability and a degree of research background, will help with prioritising research questions, and a manageable rate of  project branching. 

### Scaling the research programme

What used to be a single research question, now forms the foundation of a scalable research programme.
Through the [diffusion of innovation across industry]({% link for-businesses/index.md %}), our business partners may be able to fund further research and development.
Scaling your research means that we can support with strengthening the research programme, accelerating the quality and impact of innovation,  and unlocking further opportunities for co-designing solutions that work.
