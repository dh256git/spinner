# Onboarding schedule

Whether you join our community as a volunteer, or as a trainee, we will set you up for success.
We follow a six step onboarding process, over a period of six weeks,  to ensure you have a great experience of joining your team.

This usually takes us approximately one week.
If your application is successful, we will send you a welcome letter, including this onboarding plan and a link to schedule your introductory meeting, during the first week of your onboarding.

## Week 1: Introduction

You will meet the co-founders of Project27 to welcome you, understand your interests and motivations for joining our community, select your team, answer your questions, and set you up with your first task.
To complete your first task, we will also help you get started with our task manager system.
