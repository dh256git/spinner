### A note of thank you

Until your first meeting with us, we wanted to share a short note of appreciation with you.

Thank you for expressing interest in joining our community.
Getting community members involved in project-based learning and mutual mentorship is how we can make a difference.

We envision a world where everyone has the opportunity for social and economic participation, ensuring that disabled individuals are included and benefit from personal and professional growth.
Our mission is to create personalised opportunities for skills development and pathways for personal and professional growth in a safe environment for communities of blind and learning disabled individuals.

By making a commitment to becoming a trainee or a volunteer member, you will make our vision come true.
For that, we would like to thank you, and we wish you a joyful onboarding.

Yours faithfully,  

Daniel & Danielle - The Project27 Co-Founders
